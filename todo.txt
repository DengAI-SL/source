probability of a person being in a region given that he is connected to a tower,
towers has circular coverage so even though the tower is located in a one particular region, the person may be in another




derive values for total travel from each region to others, train the model with varying risk scores to optimize the risk score matrix.
then use the derrived risk score matrix to predict for the validation set.
